## Topics:

## Task:

1. Building a template:

- Please use the template we wrote in class or write a new template yourself to work with useReducer and useContext and implement all the ָָ**CRUD operations** on the attached list in the "drillDB" file.
- Please build a reducer that can answer the following actions:

* "INITIAL_STATE" - will initial the state with the default list from the db.
* "ADD_FRIEND" - will add a friend to the list with a given name a given age and a random id.
* "REMOVE_FRIEND" - will remove a friend from the list by his/her id.
* "UPDATE_FRIEND" - will update a friend's name/age from the list by his/her id.

- create a simple form to insert a new friend.
- create a simple list to show the friends in the current state and to allow the user to update a friends name/age.
